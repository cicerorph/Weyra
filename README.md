# Weyra


## How to setup the project
First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

After, copy the `.env.template` file to `.env`,
```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

and change it! (You can use your text editor of choice, for me its nano)
```bash
nano .env
```

And finally run it:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.13. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
